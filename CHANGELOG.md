## [1.0.7] - 2025-07-19

### Fixed - CRITICAL
- **Combat Pause Setting Conflict**: Fixed critical issue where "Pause UI updates in combat" setting completely broke hover-to-show functionality
  - **Root Cause**: When `pauseUpdatesInCombat` was enabled, entering combat would completely disable the OnUpdate timer with `SetScript("OnUpdate", nil)`

### Technical
- **Timer Separation**: Separated critical hover-to-show timer from general buff update logic
- **State Preservation**: Hover functionality now immune to combat setting changes
- **Timer Accuracy**: Consumable and weapon enchant timers remain visually accurate during combat
